Please note I, as the developer of Py Tic Tac Toe am fully aware of the bug where it asks what letter you want to be twice, so please do NOT
notify me of it.

Prerequisites:
1)Python 2.7+, but version 3.6 is preferable
2)Any OS that will run Python
3)A basic knowledge of Git/Github

4)The easiest way to retrieve this game is to clone it directly from GitHub using git
I would recommend using the most basic "git clone https://github.com/awurster1/PyTicTacToe.git" command without the quotes.

To play:
1)Open a python interpreter/shell
2)Execute the command "python setup.py" without quotes OR if python is installed, meaning not a shell, simply double click on setup.py
3)The program then will ask you if you want to be "X or O", and all you have to do is type "X" or "O" without the quotes. 
4)Once again, I'm aware of the bug where it asks twice when you first open the program.
5)To select the location of where to put your X or O, use the 10-key on your keyboard. 

Understanding file structure:
AI.py contains the code for the AI that you will play against
players.py contains the code that the player needs to be able to play the game properly
setup.py contains the game logic and also draws the physical way the board looks.
__init__.py initializes the game.
LICENSE contains the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE version 3.0
